Welcome everyone! I'm very happy to see you around, and I hope this repository brings lots of value for those learning more about GitHub Actions. Make sure to check the link above for a great discourse on the course in Udemy, where I not only provide theoretical explanations around all the concepts here, but also go in details through the entire coding of the examples in this repository.

Here are a few tips for you to best navigate the contents of this repository:
1. Workflow examples are all located in the `.github/workflows` directory. Each example has a matching top-level directory where all the necessary code is stored, together with a README.md file with more information about the topic.
2. For each workflow file, make sure to check the history of that file in GitHub. I often make several commits per file, and checking the history helps to understand how the workflow has evolved. The commits also mirror closely the individual steps I take during the recordings of my course.
3. You can easily browse all the commits related to a single topic by searching on GitHub's top-right search bar by the name of the folder of that topic (for example, for commits related to reusable workflows, look for `18-reusable-workflows`). I made sure to include the topic in every commit, so everything is very easy to follow and understand.
